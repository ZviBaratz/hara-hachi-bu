# User Guide

This guide covers all of the extension's features in detail.

## Topics

### [Battery Modes](battery-modes.md)

Understand what Full Capacity, Balanced, and Max Lifespan mean — including the battery science behind why limiting charge extends lifespan, and the economic and environmental arguments for doing so.

### [Profiles](profiles.md)

Learn how profiles work: the built-in Docked and Travel scenarios, creating custom profiles, combining power mode with battery mode, and the Boost Charge toggle for one-off full charges.

### [Auto-Switch Rules](rules.md)

Set up rule-based automatic profile switching. Rules respond to external display connection, power source (AC/battery), lid state, and battery level. Understand how specificity determines which profile wins when multiple rules match.

### [Scheduled Profiles](schedules.md)

Configure time-based profile activation — select days of the week, set a time range, and let the extension handle switching automatically. Covers overnight schedules (e.g., 23:00–07:00), DST handling, and conflict detection.

### [Manual Override](manual-override.md)

Understand what happens when you manually change settings while auto-switching is active — how auto-management pauses, what triggers it to resume, and how to resume it yourself.
